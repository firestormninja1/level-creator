# level-creator
currently allows you to make levels, however am thinking of allowing loading of levels too :)
Instructions:
- press d,g to change between dirt block (saved as 2), grass block(saved as 1) . So when exporting, and reading the lines in ur main project file, it will mean that when reading through, the 0s will be ignored. 
- hold left click to place objects
- hold right click to select eraser tool. this essentially sets the color to background color, in this case; black background which will be saved as 0 in the final export of a 2d array. 
- close window or press escape key to exit and display a map. (which is just a 2d array)
- pretty simple so far, there really aren't many features yet
- if you cba to download it, here's a repl.it file for it but it wont really run as smooth:
